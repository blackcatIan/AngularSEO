# What's AngularSEO

AngularSEO is a JEE filter make AngularJS + JEE web site can be crawled by search engines. It will begin work when site is crawled by search engine robots. It will response the robot with a static version site, and all hashbang urls are well transformed. So the robot will crawl your site just as it crawling a normal static content site.

# How it works?

* When web application started and received the first request, AngularSEO will start a crawler to crawl the whole site, and generate a static version of the site in a cache folder.
* AngularSEO filter will check the User-Agent keyword in http header to identify if the request is from search engine robot. 
* If it is a robot request, AngularSEO filter will response with a static page instead
* All hashbang links in the page will be well transformed to normal links. e.g. http://www.abc.com/#!/about -> http://www.abc.com/_23_21/about. So the hashbang links would also be crawled normally.
* That is to say, the robot will crawl the site just as it crawling a normal static content site.

# Sample static page

Original AngularJS page source code:
```
<a href="#about"><div ng-bind="message"></div></a>
```
->
Static page source code:
```
<a href="http://host/_23/about"><div ng-bind="message">the true message after binding</div></a>
```
# Advantages

* Non-invasion: needn't change the code of the original site, add a JAVA filter in the web.xml only.
* Quick response: the static version site is pre-generated and be updated periodically, so it can response more quickly than original version.
* Support all searching engines: The robot is identified by User-Agent, and the User-Agent keywords can be customized to support more search engines. The Google, Bing, Baidu User-Agent keywords are default embeded.

# Requirements

The static site is generated by [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), so it need be installed on the server. 

# More

This project is still in the validation phase and I create a simple AngularJS site in http://www.angularseo.net to validate it. If this site can be indexed by Google, Bing and Baidu, then the AngularSEO Filter works. Otherwise, it needs polishing.

# Guide

Because this project is still in the validation phase, so I have not published a jar and maven release. When this site can be indexed by Google, Bing engines, I will publish a formal release and provide a more detail guide.

The simple guide is:
* Install PhantonJS, extract it on the server
* Download the AngularSEO project, add angular-seo-filter dependency to your web app project and configure the web.xml. More detail config please refer to the angular-seo-web/web.xml for a sample.
